Big data is a term for data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate.
Challenges include analysis, capture, data curation, search, sharing,storage, transfer, visualization, querying, updating and information privacy.
The term often refers simply to the use of predictive analytics or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set.
Accuracy in big data may lead to more confident decision making, and better decisions can result in greater operational efficiency, cost reduction and reduced risk.
Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to "spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on."[3] Scientists, business executives, practitioners of medicine, advertising andgovernments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data sets in areas including Internet search, finance and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics,[4] connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology and environmental research.[5]
Data sets are growing rapidly in part because they are increasingly gathered by cheap and numerous information-sensing mobile devices, aerial (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.[6][7]The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[8] as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes(2.5Ã—1018) of data is created.[9] One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big data initiatives that affect the entire organization
