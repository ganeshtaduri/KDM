intermediary call elector who almost always have pledge to vote for particular presidential and vice presidential candidate though unpledged elector be possible and who be themselves select accord to the particular law of each state elector be apportion to each of the state as well as to the District of Columbia also know as Washington D C the number of elector in each state be equal to the number of member of Congress to which the state be entitle while the twenty third amendment grant the District of Columbia the same number of elector as the least populous state currently three therefore there be currently elector correspond to the Representatives and Senators plus the three additional elector from the District of Columbia The Constitution bar any federal official elect or appoint from be a elector except for the elector in Maine and Nebraska elector be elect on a winner take all basis that be all elector pledge to the presidential candidate who win the most vote in a state become elector for that state Maine and Nebraska use the congressional district method select one elector within each congressional district by popular vote and select the remain two elector by a statewide popular vote although no elector be require by federal law to honor a pledge there have be very few occasion when a elector vote contrary to a pledge the Twelfth Amendment in specify how a president and vice president be elect require each elector to cast one vote for president and another vote for vice president the candidate who receive a absolute majority of electoral vote currently for the office of president or of vice president be elect to that office the Twelfth Amendment provide for what happen if the Electoral College fail to elect a president or vice president if no candidate receive a majority for president then the House of Representatives will select the president with each state delegation instead of each representative have only one vote if no candidate receive a majority for vice president then the Senate will select the vice president with each senator have one vote on four occasion most recently in the Electoral College system have result in the election of a candidate who do not receive the most popular vote in the election background the Constitutional Convention in use the Virginia Plan as the basis for discussion as the Virginia delegation have propose it first the Virginia Plan call for the Congress to elect the president Delegates from a majority of state agree to this mode of election however the Committee of eleven form to work out various detail include the mode of election of the president recommend instead that the election be by a group of people apportion among the state in the same number as they representative in Congress the formula for which have be resolve in lengthy debate result in the Connecticut compromise and three fifth compromise but choose by each state in such manner as its Legislature may direct Committee member Gouverneur Morris explain the reason for the change among other there be fear of intrigue if the president be choose by a small group of man who meet together regularly as well as concern for the independence of the president if he be elect by the Congress some delegate include James Wilson and James Madison prefer popular election of the executive Madison acknowledge that while a popular vote would be ideal it would be difficult to get consensus on the proposal give the prevalence of slavery in the South there be one difficulty however of a serious nature attend a immediate choice by the people the right of suffrage be much more diffusive in the northern than the Southern States and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of negro the substitution of elector obviate this difficulty and seem on the whole to be liable to the fewest objection the Convention approve the Committee s Electoral College proposal with minor modification on September Delegates from the small state generally favor the Electoral College out of concern that the large state would otherwise control presidential election in the Federalist Papers James Madison explain he view on the selection of the president and the Constitution in Federalist No Madison argue that the Constitution be design to be a mixture of state base and population base government Congress would have two house the state base Senate and the population base House of Representatives meanwhile the president would be elect by a mixture of the two mode additionally in the Federalist No James Madison argue against a interested and overbearing majority and the mischief of faction in a electoral system he define a faction as a number of citizen whether amount to a majority or minority of the whole who be unite and actuate by some common impulse of passion or of interest adverse to the rights of other citizen or to the permanent and aggregate interest of the community republican government i e federalism as oppose to direct democracy with its varied distribution of voter rights and power would countervail against faction Madison further postulate in the Federalist No that the greater the population and expanse of the Republic the more difficulty faction would face in organize due to such issue as sectionalism although the United States Constitution refer to Electors and elector neither the phrase Electoral College nor any other name be use to describe the elector collectively it be not until the early th century that the name Electoral College come into general usage as the collective designation for the elector select to cast vote for president and vice president it be first write into federal law in and today the term appear in U S C in the section head and in the text as college of elector history original plan Article II Section clause of the Constitution state each state shall appoint in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct a number of elector equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the state may be entitle in the Congress but no Senator or Representative or person hold a Office of Trust or profit under the United States shall be appoint a Elector Article II Section clause of the Constitution state the Congress may determine the time of chus the Electors and the day on which they shall give they vote which Day shall be the same throughout the United States Article II Section clause of the Constitution provide for the original fashion by which the president and vice president be to be choose by the elector in the original system the candidate who receive a majority of vote from the elector would become president the candidate receive the second most vote would become vice president the design of the Electoral College be base upon several assumption and anticipation of the framer of the Constitution each state legislature would determine a system of allocate elector first system include legislature district plan and direct popular voting each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when vote candidate would not pair together on the same ticket with assume placement toward each office of president and vice president the system as design would rarely produce a winner thus send the election to Congress on these fact some scholar have describe the Electoral College as be intend to nominate candidate from which the Congress would then select a president and vice president each state government be free to have its own plan for select its elector and the Constitution do not require state to popularly elect they elector several different method for select elector be describe at length below Breakdown and revision the emergence of political party and nationally coordinate election campaign soon complicate matter in the election of and in Federalist Party candidate John Adams win the presidential election by finish in second place democratic Republican Party candidate Thomas Jefferson the Federalists opponent become the vice president this result in the President and Vice President not be of the same political party in the democratic Republican Party again nominate Jefferson for president and also nominate Aaron Burr for vice president after the election Jefferson and Burr both obtain a majority of electoral vote but tie one another with vote each since ballot do not distinguish between vote for president and vote for vice president every ballot cast for Burr technically count as a vote for he to become president despite Jefferson clearly be he party be first choice lack a clear winner by constitutional standard the election have to be decide by the House of Representatives pursuant to the Constitution s contingency election provision have already lose the presidential contest Federalist Party representative in the lame duck House session seize upon the opportunity to embarrass they opposition and attempt to elect Burr over Jefferson The House deadlock for ballot as neither candidate receive the necessary majority vote of the state delegation in the House the vote of nine state be need for a election Jefferson achieve electoral victory on the th ballot but only after Federalist Party leader Alexander Hamilton who disfavor Burr s personal character more than Jefferson be policy have make known he preference for Jefferson Responding to the problem from those election the Congress propose the Twelfth Amendment in prescribe elector cast separate ballot for president and vice president to replace the system outline in Article II Section clause by June the state have ratify the amendment in time for the election fourteenth amendment section of the fourteenth amendment allow for a state be representation in the House of Representatives to be reduce to the extent that state unconstitutionally deny people the right to vote on May during a debate on the fourteenth amendment Thaddeus Stevens the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives deliver a speech on the amendment be intent regard section he say the second section I consider the most important in the article it fix the basis of representation in Congress if any state shall exclude any of she adult male citizen from the elective franchise or abridge that right she shall forfeit she right to representation in the same proportion the effect of this provision will be either to compel the States to grant universal suffrage or so shear they of they power as to keep they forever in a hopeless minority in the national government both legislative and executive federal law U S C implement section s mandate Modern mechanic Summary even though the aggregate national popular vote be calculate by state official media organization and the Federal Election Commission the people only indirectly elect the president as the national popular vote be not the basis for elect the president or vice president the President and Vice President of the United States be elect by the Electoral College which consist of presidential elector from the fifty state and Washington D C presidential elector be select on a state by state basis as determine by the law of each state since the election of most state have appoint they elector on a winner take all basis base on the statewide popular vote on Election Day Maine and Nebraska be the only two current exception as both state use the congressional district method although ballot list the name of the presidential and vice presidential candidate who run on a ticket voter actually choose elector when they vote for president and vice president these presidential elector in turn cast electoral vote for those two office elector usually pledge to vote for they party be nominee but some faithless elector have vote for other candidate a candidate must receive a absolute majority of electoral vote currently to win the presidency or the vice presidency if no candidate receive a majority in the election for president or vice president that election be determine via a contingency procedure establish by the Twelfth Amendment in such a situation the House choose one of the top three presidential electoral vote winner as the president while the Senate choose one of the top two vice presidential electoral vote winner as vice president elector apportionment a state be number of elector equal the number of representative and senator the state have in the United States Congress in the case of representative this be base on the respective population each state be number of representative be determine every year by the United States Census in the case of senator each state be entitle to two under the twenty third amendment Washington D C be allocate as many elector as it would have if it be a state but no more elector than the least populous state the least populous state which be Wyoming accord to the Census have three elector thus d c can not have more than three elector even if d c be a state its population would entitle it to only three elector base on its population per electoral vote d c have the second highest per capita Electoral College representation after Wyoming Currently there be a total of elector there be representative and senator plus the three elector allocate to Washington D C The six state with the most elector be California Texas New York Florida Illinois and Pennsylvania the seven smallest state by population Alaska Delaware Montana North Dakota South Dakota Vermont and Wyoming have three elector each this be because each of these state be entitle to one representative and two senator selection Article II Section clause of the Constitution require each state legislature to determine how elector for the state be to be choose but it disqualify any person hold a federal office either elect or appoint from be a elector under section of the fourteenth Amendment any person who have swear a oath to support the United States Constitution in order to hold either a state or federal office and later rebel against the United States be disqualify from be a elector however the Congress may remove this disqualification by a two third vote in each House Candidates for elector be nominate by they state political party in the month prior to Election Day in some state the elector be nominate in primary the same way that other candidate be nominate in some state such as Oklahoma Virginia and North Carolina elector be nominate in party convention in Pennsylvania the campaign committee of each candidate name they candidate for elector a attempt to discourage faithless elector since the civil war all state have choose presidential elector by popular vote this process have be normalize to the point that the name of the elector appear on the ballot only in a handful of state the Tuesday follow the first Monday in November have be fix as the day for hold federal election call the Election Day forty eight state and Washington D C employ the winner take all method each award its elector as a single bloc Maine and Nebraska use the congressional district method select one elector within each congressional district by popular vote and select the remain two elector by a statewide popular vote this method have be use in Maine since and in Nebraska since the current system of choose elector be call the short ballot in most state voter choose a slate of elector and only a few state list on the ballot the name of propose elector in some state if a voter want to write in a candidate for president the voter be also require to write in the name of propose elector after the election each state prepare seven certificate of Ascertainment each list the candidate for president and vice president they pledge elector and the total vote each candidacy receive one certificate be send as soon after Election Day as practicable to the National Archivist in Washington D C The Certificates of Ascertainment be mandate to carry the State Seal and the signature of the governor in the case of the District of Columbia the Certificate be sign by the Mayor of the District of Columbia meeting the Electoral College never actually meet as one body elector choose on Election Day meet in they respective state capital elector for the District of Columbia meet within the District on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December at which time they cast they electoral vote on separate ballot for president and vice president although procedure in each state vary slightly the elector generally follow a similar series of step and the Congress have constitutional authority to regulate the procedure the state follow the meeting be open by the election certification official often that state s secretary of state or equivalent who read the certificate of Ascertainment this document set forth who be choose to cast the electoral vote the attendance of the elector be take and any vacancy be note in write the next step be the selection of a president or chairman of the meeting sometimes also with a vice chairman the elector sometimes choose a secretary often not himself a elector to take the minute of the meeting in many state political official give short speech at this point in the proceedings when the time for balloting arrive the elector choose one or two people to act as teller some state provide for the place in nomination of a candidate to receive the electoral vote the candidate for president of the political party of the elector each elector submit a write ballot with the name of a candidate for president in New Jersey the elector cast ballot by check the name of the candidate on a pre print card in North Carolina the elector write the name of the candidate on a blank card the teller count the ballot and announce the result the next step be the casting of the vote for vice president which follow a similar pattern each state be elector must complete six certificate of vote each certificate of vote must be sign by all of the elector and a certificate of Ascertainment must be attach to each of the certificate of vote each certificate of vote must include the name of those who receive a electoral vote for either the office of president or of vice president the elector certify the certificate of vote and copy of the certificate be then send in the follow fashion one be send by registered mail to the President of the Senate who usually be the vice president two be send by registered mail to the archivist of the United States two be send to the state be Secretary of State and one be send to the chief judge of the United States district court where those elector meet a staff member of the President of the Senate collect the certificate of vote as they arrive and prepare they for the joint session of the Congress the certificate be arrange unopened in alphabetical order and place in two special mahogany box Alabama through Missouri include the District of Columbia be place in one box and Montana through Wyoming be place in the other box faithlessness a faithless elector be one who cast a electoral vote for someone other than the person pledge or do not vote for any person twenty four state have law to punish faithless elector in the constitutionality of state pledge law be bring before the Supreme Court in Ray v Blair U S The Court rule in favor of state law require elector to pledge to vote for the win candidate as well as remove elector who refuse to pledge as state in the ruling elector be act as a functionary of the state not the federal government therefore state have the right to govern elector the constitutionality of state law punish elector for actually cast a faithless vote rather than refuse to pledge have never be decide by the Supreme Court while many only punish a faithless elector after the fact state like Michigan also specify that the faithless elector s vote be void as electoral slate be typically choose by the political party or the party be presidential nominee elector usually have high loyalty to the party and its candidate a faithless elector run a greater risk of party censure than criminal charge faithless elector have not change the outcome of any presidential election to date for example in elector Barbara Lett Simmons of Washington D C choose not to vote rather than vote for Al Gore as she have pledge to do this be do as a act of protest against Washington D C be lack of congressional voting representation that elector s abstention do not change who win that year be presidential election as George W Bush receive a majority of the electoral vote joint session of Congress and the contingent election the Twelfth Amendment mandate that the Congress assemble in joint session to count the electoral vote and declare the winner of the election the session be ordinarily require to take place on January in the calendar year immediately follow the meeting of the presidential elector since the Twentieth Amendment the newly elect House declare the winner of the election all election before be determine by the outgoing House instead the meeting be hold at pm in the Chamber of the U S House of Representatives the sit vice president be expect to preside but in several case the President pro tempore of the Senate have chair the proceedings instead the vice president and the Speaker of the House sit at the podium with the vice president in the seat of the Speaker of the House Senate page bring in the two mahogany box contain each state be certified vote and place they on table in front of the senator and representative each house appoint two teller to count the vote normally one member of each political party relevant portion of the certificate of vote be read for each state in alphabetical order member of Congress can object to any state be vote count provide that the objection be present in write and be sign by at least one member of each house of Congress a objection support by at least one senator and one representative will be follow by the suspension of the joint session and by separate debate and vote in each House of Congress after both house deliberate on the objection the joint session be resume a state be certificate of vote can be reject only if both house of Congress vote to accept the objection in that case the vote from the state in question be simply ignore the vote of Arkansas and Louisiana be reject in the presidential election of objection to the electoral vote count be rarely raise although it do occur during the vote count in after the close presidential election between governor George W Bush of Texas and the Vice President of the United States Al Gore Vice President Gore who as vice president be require to preside over he own Electoral College defeat by five electoral vote deny the objection all of which be raise only by several House member and would have favor he candidacy after no senator would agree to jointly object objection be again raise in the vote count of the election and on that occasion the document be present by one representative and one senator although the joint session be suspend the objection be quickly dispose of and reject by both house of Congress if there be no objection or all objection be overrule the preside officer simply include a state be vote as declare in the certificate of vote in the official tally after the certificate from all state be read and the respective vote be count the preside officer simply announce the final result of the vote and provide that the require absolute majority of vote be achieve declare the name of the person elect president and vice president this announcement conclude the joint session and formalize the recognition of the president elect and of the vice president elect the senator then depart from the House Chamber The final tally be print in the Senate and House journal contingent presidential election by House Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment the House of Representatives be require to go into session immediately to vote for president if no candidate for president receive a majority of the electoral vote since of the electoral vote in this event the House of Representatives be limit to choose from among the three candidate who receive the most electoral vote each state delegation vote en bloc each delegation have a single vote the District of Columbia do not receive a vote a candidate must receive a absolute majority of state delegation vote i e at present a minimum of vote in order for that candidate to become the President elect additionally delegation from at least two third of all the state must be present for vote to take place the House continue balloting until it elect a president the House of Representatives have choose the president only twice in under Article II Section clause and in under the Twelfth Amendment Contingent vice presidential election by Senate if no candidate for vice president receive a absolute majority of electoral vote then the Senate must go into session to elect a vice president the Senate be limit to choose from only the top two candidate to have receive electoral vote one fewer than the number to which the House be limited the Senate vote in the normal manner in this case i e ballot be individually cast by each senator not by state delegation however two third of the senator must be present for vote to take place additionally the Twelfth Amendment state that a majority of the whole number of senator currently of be necessary for election further the language require a absolute majority of Senate vote preclude the sit vice president from break any tie which might occur although this be dispute by some legal scholar the only time the Senate choose the vice president be in in that instance the Senate adopt a alphabetical roll call and voting aloud the rule further state I f a majority of the number of senator shall vote for either the say Richard M Johnson or Francis Granger he shall be declare by the preside officer of the Senate constitutionally elect Vice President of the United States the Senate choose Johnson Deadlocked chamber if the House of Representatives have not choose a president elect in time for the inauguration noon on January then section of the Twentieth Amendment specify that the vice president elect become acting president until the House select a president if there be also no vice president elect in time for the inauguration then under the Presidential Succession Act of the sit Speaker of the House would become acting president until either the House select a president or the Senate select a vice president neither of these situation have ever occur current electoral vote distribution the follow table show the number of electoral vote ev to which each state and the District of Columbia will be entitle during the and presidential election the number in parenthesis represent the number of electoral vote that a state gain or lose because of reapportionment follow the Census the twenty third amendment grant elector to dc as if it be a state but not more than the least populous state this have always be three Maine and Nebraska elector distribute by way of the Congressional District Method or represent number of elector gain or lose in comparison to electoral college allocation chronological table source http psepho adam carr net country u usa pre shtml note in and each elector cast two vote for president alternative method of choose elector before the advent of the short ballot in the early th century as describe above the most common means of elect the presidential elector be through the general ticket the general ticket be quite similar to the current system and be often confuse with it in the general ticket voter cast ballot for individual run for presidential elector while in the short ballot voter cast ballot for a entire slate of elector in the general ticket the state canvass would report the number of vote cast for each candidate for elector a complicated process in state like New York with multiple position to fill both the general ticket and the short ballot be often consider at large or winner take all vote the short ballot be adopt by the various state at different time it be adopt for use by North Carolina and Ohio in Alabama be still use the general ticket as late as and be one of the last state to switch to the short ballot the question of the extent to which state constitution may constrain the legislature be choice of a method of choose elector have be touch on in two U S Supreme Court case in McPherson v blacker U S the Court cite Article II Section clause which state that a state be elector be select in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct and write that these word operat e as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power in Bush v Palm Beach County Canvassing Board U S a Florida Supreme Court decision be vacate not reverse base on McPherson on the other hand three dissent justice in Bush v Gore U S write nothing in Article II of the Federal Constitution free the state legislature from the constraint in the State Constitution that create it appointment by state legislature in the earliest presidential election state legislative choice be the most common method of choose elector a majority of the state select presidential elector by legislation in both of and of and half of the state do so in even in the election a quarter of state of choose elector by legislation in that election Andrew Jackson lose in spite of have plurality of both the popular and electoral vote with the outcome be decide by the six state legislature choose the elector some state legislature simply choose elector while other state use a hybrid method in which state legislature choose from a group of elector elect by popular vote by with the rise of jacksonian democracy only Delaware and South Carolina use legislative choice Delaware end its practice the follow election while South Carolina continue use the method until it secede from the Union in December South Carolina use the popular vote for the first time in the election exclude South Carolina legislative appointment be use in only four situation after in Massachusetts statute award the state be electoral vote to the winner of the at large popular vote but only if that candidate win a absolute majority when the vote produce no winner between the democratic Free Soil and Whig party the state legislature select the elector give all electoral vote to the Whigs in Nevada have join the Union only a few day prior to Election Day have no choice but to appoint in the newly reconstruct state of Florida appoint its elector have be readmit too late to hold election finally in the legislature of the newly admit state of Colorado use legislative choice due to a lack of time and money to hold a popular election legislative appointment be brandish as a possibility in the election have the recount continue the Florida legislature be prepare to appoint the republican slate of elector to avoid miss the federal safe harbor deadline for choose elector the Constitution give each state legislature the power to decide how its state be elector be choose and it can be easier and cheaper for a state legislature to simply appoint a slate of elector than to create a legislative framework for hold election to determine the elector as note above the two situation in which legislative choice have be use since the civil war have both be because there be not enough time or money to prepare for a election however appointment by state legislature can have negative consequence bicameral legislature can deadlock more easily than the electorate this be precisely what happen to New York in when the legislature fail to appoint any elector Electoral district another method use early in U S history be to divide the state into electoral district by this method voter in each district would cast they ballot for the candidate they support and the winner in each district would receive that electoral vote this be similar to how state be currently separate by congressional district however the difference stem from the fact that every state always have two more electoral district than congressional district as with congressional district moreover this method be vulnerable to gerrymandering proportional vote under such a system elector would be select in proportion to the vote cast for they candidate or party rather than be select by the statewide plurality vote congressional district method there be two version of the congressional district method one have be implement in Maine and Nebraska another that have be propose in Virginia under the implement Congressional District Method the electoral vote be distribute base on the popular vote winner within each of the state be congressional district the statewide popular vote winner receive two additional electoral vote in a different version of the Congressional District Method be propose in Virginia this version would distribute Virginia s electoral vote base on the popular vote winner within each of Virginia be congressional district the two statewide electoral vote would be award base on which candidate win the most congressional district rather than on who win Virginia s statewide popular vote the Congressional District Method can more easily be implement than other alternative to the winner take all method state legislation be sufficient to use this method advocate of the Congressional District Method believe the system would encourage higher voter turnout and incentivize presidential candidate to broaden they campaign in non competitive state winner take all system ignore thousand of popular vote in democratic California there be republican district in Republican Texas there be democratic district because candidate have a incentive to campaign in competitive district with a district plan candidate have a incentive to actively campaign in over thirty state versus seven swing state opponent of the system however argue that candidate might only spend time in certain battleground district instead of the entire state and case of gerrymandering could become exacerbated as political party attempt to draw as many safe district as they can unlike simple congressional district comparison the District Plan popular vote bonus in the election would have give Obama of the Electoral College versus the he do win it would have more closely approximate the percentage of the popular vote win Implementation of the state whose electoral vote could be affect by the Congressional District Method only Maine and Nebraska apply it Maine have four electoral vote base on its two representative and two senator Nebraska have two senator and three representative give it five electoral vote Maine begin use the Congressional District Method in the election of Nebraska have use the Congressional District Method since the election of since the s the only other state to have use the system be Michigan which only use the system for the presidential election the Congressional District Method allow a state the chance to split its electoral vote between multiple candidate before neither Maine nor Nebraska have ever split they electoral vote Nebraska split its electoral vote for the first time in give John McCain its statewide elector and those of two congressional district while Barack Obama win the electoral vote of Nebraska be nd congressional district follow the split some Nebraska Republicans make effort to discard the Congressional District Method and return to the winner take all system in January a bill be introduce in the Nebraska legislature to revert to a winner take all system the bill die in committee in March Republicans have also pass bill in and to eliminate the Congressional District Method in Nebraska but those bill be veto by democratic governor Ben Nelson in Republicans in Pennsylvania who control both house of the legislature as well as the governorship put forward a plan to change the state be winner take all system to a congressional district method system Pennsylvania have vote for the democratic candidate in the five previous presidential election so many see this as a attempt to take away democratic electoral vote although Democrat Barack Obama win Pennsylvania in he only win a minority of the state be congressional district the plan later lose support other republican include Michigan state representative Pete Lund RNC Chairman Reince Priebus and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker have float similar idea Contemporary issue argument between proponent and opponent of the current electoral system include four separate but related topic indirect election disproportionate voting power by some state the winner take all distribution method as choose by of the state and federalism argument against the Electoral College in common discussion mostly focus on the allocation of the voting power among the state Gary Bugh be research of congressional debate over propose Electoral College amendment reveal that reform opponent have often appeal to a traditional version of representation whereas reform advocate have tend to reference a more democratic view Criticism Irrelevancy of national popular vote the election of and produce a Electoral College winner who do not receive at least a plurality of the nationwide popular vote in there be six state in which elector be legislatively appoint rather than popularly elect so the true national popular vote be uncertain when no candidate receive a majority of electoral vote in the election be decide by the House of Representatives and so could be consider distinct from the latter three election in which all of the state have popular selection of elector the true national popular vote be also uncertain in the election and the plurality for the winner depend on how vote for Alabama elector be allocate opponent of the Electoral College claim that such outcome do not logically follow the normative concept of how a democratic system should function one view be that the Electoral College violate the principle of political equality since presidential election be not decide by the one person one vote principle outcome of this sort be attributable to the federal nature of the system supporter of the Electoral College argue that candidate must build a popular base that be geographically broader and more diverse in voter interest this feature be not a logical consequence of have intermediate election of president but rather the winner take all method of allocate each state be slate of elector allocation of elector in proportion to the state be popular vote could reduce this effect scenario exhibit this outcome typically result when the win candidate have win the requisite configuration of state and thus they vote by small margin but the lose candidate capture large voter margin in the remain state in this case the very large margin secure by the lose candidate in the other state would aggregate to well over percent of the ballot cast nationally in a two candidate race with equal voter turnout in every district and no faithless elector a candidate could win the electoral college while win only about of the nationwide popular vote this would require the candidate in question to win each one of the follow state by just one vote Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Hawaii Idaho Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico North Dakota Oklahoma Oregon Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Utah Vermont Virginia West Virginia Wisconsin and Wyoming A result of the present functionality of the Electoral College be that the national popular vote bear no legal or factual significance on determine the outcome of the election since the national popular vote be irrelevant both voter and candidate be assume to base they campaign strategy around the existence of the Electoral College any close race have candidate campaign to maximize electoral vote by capture coveted swing state not to maximize national popular vote total the United States be the only country that elect a politically powerful president via a electoral college and the only one in which a candidate can become president without have obtain the highest number of vote in the sole or final round of popular voting exclusive focus on large swing state accord to this criticism the electoral college encourage political campaigner to focus on a few so call swing state while ignore the rest of the country populous state in which pre election poll result show no clear favorite be inundate with campaign visit saturation television advertising get out the vote effort by party organizer and debate while four out of five voter in the national election be absolutely ignore accord to one assessment since most state use a winner take all arrangement in which the candidate with the most vote in that state receive all of the state be electoral vote there be a clear incentive to focus almost exclusively on only a few key undecided state in recent election these state have include Pennsylvania Ohio and Florida in and and also Colorado in In contrast state with large population such as California Texas and New York have in recent election be consider safe for a particular party democratic for California and New York and Republican for Texas and therefore campaign spend less time and money there many small state be also consider to be safe for one of the two political party and be also generally ignore by campaigner of the smallest state six be reliably democratic six be reliably republican and only New Hampshire be consider as a swing state accord to critic George C Edwards III in the election campaign do not mount nationwide effort but rather focus on select state it be possible to win the election by win eleven state and disregard the rest of the country if one ticket be to take California vote Texas New York Florida Illinois Pennsylvania Ohio Michigan Georgia North Carolina and New Jersey that ticket would have vote which would be enough to win in the close election of and these eleven state give vote to republican candidate George W Bush and vote to democratic candidate Al Gore and John Kerry in the democratic candidate Barack Obama win nine of these eleven state for electoral vote with Republican John McCain take a combined electoral vote from Texas and Georgia proponent of the Electoral College claim that adoption of the popular vote would shift the disproportionate focus to large city at the expense of rural area candidate might also be incline to campaign hardest in they base area to maximize turnout among core supporter and ignore more closely divide part of the country proponent of a national popular vote for president dismiss such argument point out that candidate in popular vote election for governor and U S Senate and for statewide allocation of electoral vote do not ignore voter in less populated area discourage turnout and participation except in closely fight swing state voter turnout be largely insignificant due to entrenched political party domination in most state the Electoral College decrease the advantage a political party or campaign might gain for encouraging voter to turn out except in those swing state if the presidential election be decide by a national popular vote in contrast campaign and party would have a strong incentive to work to increase turnout everywhere individual would similarly have a stronger incentive to persuade they friend and neighbor to turn out to vote the difference in turnout between swing state and non swing state under the current electoral college system suggest that replace the Electoral College with direct election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and participation significantly obscure disenfranchisement within state accord to this criticism the electoral college reduce election to a mere count of elector for a particular state and as a result it obscure any voting problem within a particular state for example if a particular state block some group from vote perhaps by voter suppression method such as impose reading test poll tax registration requirement or legally disfranchise specific minority group then vote inside that state would be reduce but the state be electoral count would be the same so disenfranchisement have no effect on the overall electoral tally critic contend that such disenfranchisement be partially obscure by the Electoral College A related argument be that the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout there be no incentive for state to reach out to more of its citizen to include they in election because the state be electoral count remain fix in any event accord to this view if election be by popular vote then state would be motivate to include more citizen in election since the state would then have more political clout nationally critic contend that the electoral college system insulate state from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalty for disenfranch subgroup of citizen legal scholar Akhil Amar and Vikram Amar have argue that the original Electoral College compromise be enact partially because it enable the southern state to disenfranchise its slave population it permit southern state to disfranchise large number of slave while allow these state to maintain political clout within the federation by use the three fifth compromise they note that constitutional Framer James Madison believe that the question of count slave have present a serious challenge but that the substitution of elector obviate this difficulty and seem on the whole to be liable to the fewest objection Akhil and Vikram Amar add that the founder system also encourage the continue disfranchisement of woman in a direct national election system any state that give woman the vote would automatically have double its national clout under the Electoral College however a state have no such incentive to increase the franchise as with slave what matter be how many woman live in a state not how many be empower a state with low voter turnout get precisely the same number of electoral vote as if it have a high turnout by contrast a well design direct election system could spur state to get out the vote lack of enfranchisement of U S territory Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico the Northern Mariana Islands the U S Virgin Islands American Samoa and Guam be not entitle to elector in presidential election constitutionally only U S state per Article II Section clause and Washington D C per the twenty third amendment be entitle to elector Guam have hold non binding straw poll for president since the s to draw attention to this fact this have also lead to various scholar conclude that the U S national electoral process be not fully democratic Favors less populous state as a consequence of give more per capita voting power to the less populated state the Electoral College give extra power to voter in those state for example a electoral vote represent over two time as many people in New York than in South Dakota in one countervail analysis about smaller state gain a Electoral College advantage the Banzhaf power index bpi model base on probability theory be use to test the hypothesis that citizen of small state accrue more election power it be find that in individual voter in California the largest state have time more individual power to choose a president than voter of Montana the largest of the minimum elector state Banzhaf be method have be criticize for treat vote like coin flip and more empirically base model of vote yield result which seem to favor larger state less disadvantage for third party in practice the winner take all manner of allocate a state be elector generally decrease the importance of minor party however it have be argue that the electoral college be not a cause of the two party system and that it have a tendency to improve the chance of third party candidate in some situation not straightforward one view be that the electoral college be overly and unnecessarily complex the electoral college do not provide a straightforward process for select the president instead it can be extraordinarily complex and have the potential to undo the people s will at many point in the long journey from the selection of elector to count they vote in Congress support prevent a urban centric victory proponent of the Electoral College claim the Electoral College prevent a candidate from win the presidency by simply win in heavily populated urban area this mean that candidate must make a wider geographic appeal than they would if they simply have to win the national popular vote maintain the federal character of the nation the United States of America be a federal coalition which consist of component state proponent of the current system argue that the collective opinion of even a small state merit attention at the federal level greater than that give to a small though numerically equivalent portion of a very populous state the system also allow each state the freedom within constitutional bound to design its own law on voting and enfranchisement without a undue incentive to maximize the number of vote cast for many year early in the nation be history up until the jacksonian era many state appoint they elector by a vote of the state legislature and proponent argue that in the end the election of the President must still come down to the decision of each state or the federal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive centralized government in he book a more Perfect Constitution Professor Larry Sabato elaborate on this advantage of the Electoral College argue to mend it don t end it in part because of its usefulness in force candidate to pay attention to lightly populated state and reinforce the role of the state in federalism enhance status of minority group instead of decrease the power of minority group by depress voter turnout proponent argue that by make the vote of a give state a all or nothing affair minority group can provide the critical edge that allow a candidate to win this encourage candidate to court a wide variety of such minority and advocacy group encourage stability through the two party system many proponent of the Electoral College see its negative effect on third party as beneficial they argue that the two party system have provide stability because it encourage a delay adjustment during time of rapid political and cultural change they believe it protect the most powerful office in the country from control by what these proponent view as regional minority until they can moderate they view to win broad long term support across the nation advocate of a national popular vote for president suggest that this effect would also be true in popular vote election of election for governor between and for example more than be win by candidate secure more than of the vote and none have be win with less than of the vote flexibility if a presidential candidate die accord to this argument the fact that the Electoral College be make up of real people instead of mere number allow for human judgment and flexibility to make a decision if it happen that a candidate die or become legally disabled around the time of the election advocate of the current system argue that human elector would be in a better position to choose a suitable replacement than the general voting public accord to this view elector could act decisively during the critical time interval between when ballot choice become fix in state ballot until mid December when the elector formally cast they ballot in the election of lose democratic candidate Horace Greeley die during this time interval which result in democratic disarray but the Greeley elector be able to split they vote for different alternate candidate a situation in which the win candidate die have never happen in the election of Vice President Sherman die shortly before the election when it be too late for state to remove he name from they ballot accordingly Sherman be list posthumously but the eight electoral vote that Sherman would have receive be cast instead for Nicholas Murray Butler isolation of election problem some supporter of the Electoral College note that it isolate the impact of any election fraud or other such problem to the state where it occur it prevent instance where a party dominant in one state may dishonestly inflate the vote for a candidate and thereby affect the election outcome for instance recount occur only on a state by state basis not nationwide critic of the current system suggest that the result in a single state such as Florida in can decide the national election and thus not keep any problem in such a state isolate from the rest of the nation proposal for reform or abolition Bayh Celler Constitutional amendment the closest the United States have come to abolish the Electoral College occur during the st Congress the presidential election of result in Richard Nixon receive electoral vote of elector Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace with of the popular vote however Nixon have only receive more popular vote than Humphrey to less than of the national total Representative Emanuel Celler D New York Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee respond to public concern over the disparity between the popular vote and electoral vote by introduce House Joint Resolution a propose Constitutional amendment which would have replace the Electoral College with simpler plurality system base on the national popular vote with this system the pair of candidate who have receive the highest number of vote would win the presidency and vice presidency provide they win at least of the national popular vote if no pair receive of the popular vote a runoff election would be hold in which the choice of President and vice president would be make from the two pair of person who have receive the highest number of vote in the first election the word pair be define as two person who shall have consent to the join of they name as candidate for the office of President and Vice President on April the House Judiciary Committee vote to to approve the proposal debate on the proposal before the full House of Representatives end on September and be eventually pass with bipartisan support on September by a vote of to on September President Richard Nixon give he endorsement for adoption of the proposal encourage the Senate to pass its version of the proposal which have be sponsor as Senate Joint Resolution by Senator Birch Bayh D Indiana on October the New York Times report that state legislature be either certain or likely to approve a constitutional amendment embody the direct election plan if it pass its final congressional test in the Senate ratification of state legislature would have be need for adoption the paper also report that other state have yet to state a preference be lean toward opposition and be solidly oppose on August the Senate Judiciary Committee send its report advocate passage of the proposal to the full Senate the Judiciary Committee have approve the proposal by a vote of to the six member who oppose the plan democratic Senators James Eastland of Mississippi John Little McClellan of Arkansas and Sam Ervin of North Carolina along with republican Senators Roman Hruska of Nebraska Hiram Fong of Hawaii and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina all argue that although the present system have potential loophole it have work well throughout the year Senator Bayh indicate that supporter of the measure be about a dozen vote shy from the need for the proposal to pass the full Senate he call upon President Nixon to attempt to persuade undecided republican senator to support the proposal however Nixon while not renege on he previous endorsement choose not to make any further personal appeal to back the proposal on September the Senate commence openly debate the proposal and the proposal be quickly filibuster the lead objector to the proposal be mostly southern senator and conservative from small state both democrat and republican who argue abolish the Electoral College would reduce they state political influence on September a motion for cloture which would have end the filibuster receive vote to for cloture fail to receive the then require two third majority of senator vote a second motion for cloture on September also fail by to thereafter the Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana move to lay the proposal aside so that the Senate could attend to other business however the proposal be never consider again and die when the st Congress end on January every vote count amendment a joint resolution

king extend to the declaring of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleet and army all of which would appertain to the legislature emphasis in the original Congress pursuant to the War Powers Resolution must authorize any troop deployment longer than day although that process rely on trigger mechanism that have never be employ render it ineffectual additionally Congress provide a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation while historically president initiate the process for go to war critic have charge that there have be several conflict in which president do not get official declaration include Theodore Roosevelt be military move into Panama in the korean war the Vietnam War and the invasion of Grenada in and Panama in along with the armed force the president also direct U S foreign policy through the Department of State and the Department of Defense the president be responsible for the protection of Americans abroad and of foreign national in the United States the president decide whether to recognize new nation and new government and negotiate treaty with other nation which become binding on the United States when approve by two third vote of the Senate although not constitutionally provide president also sometimes employ executive agreement in foreign relation these agreement frequently regard administrative policy choice germane to executive power for example the extent to which either country present a armed presence in a give area how each country will enforce copyright treaty or how each country will process foreign mail however the th century witness a vast expansion of the use of executive agreement and critic have challenge the extent of that use as supplant the treaty process and remove constitutionally prescribe check and balance over the executive in foreign relation supporter counter that the agreement offer a pragmatic solution when the need for swift secret and or concerted action arise administrative power the president be the head of the executive branch of the federal government and be constitutionally obligate to take care that the law be faithfully execute the executive branch have over four million employee include member of the military president make numerous executive branch appointment a incoming president may make up to before take office and more while serve ambassador member of the Cabinet and other federal officer be all appoint by a president with the advice and consent of a majority of the Senate when the Senate be in recess for at least ten day the president may make recess appointment recess appointment be temporary and expire at the end of the next session of the Senate the power of a president to fire executive official have long be a contentious political issue generally a president may remove purely executive official at will however Congress can curtail and constrain a president be authority to fire commissioner of independent regulatory agency and certain inferior executive officer by statute the president additionally possess the ability to direct much of the executive branch through executive order that be ground in federal law or constitutionally grant executive power Executive order be reviewable by federal court and can be supersede by federal legislation to manage the grow federal bureaucracy president have gradually surround themselves with many layer of staff who be eventually organize into the Executive Office of the President of the United States within the Executive Office the President be innermost layer of aide and they assistant be located in the White House Office juridical power the president also have the power to nominate federal judge include member of the United States court of appeal and the Supreme Court of the United States however these nomination do require Senate confirmation Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for president who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance when nominating judge to U S district court president often respect the long standing tradition of senatorial courtesy president may also grant pardon and reprieve as be often do just before the end of a presidential term not without controversy Historically two doctrine concern executive power have develop that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy the first be executive privilege which allow the president to withhold from disclosure any communication make directly to the president in the performance of executive duty George Washington first claim privilege when Congress request to see Chief Justice John Jay be note from a unpopular treaty negotiation with great Britain while not enshrine in the Constitution or any other law Washington be action create the precedent for the privilege when Richard Nixon try to use executive privilege as a reason for not turn over subpoena evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal the Supreme Court rule in United States v Nixon U S that executive privilege do not apply in case where a president be attempt to avoid criminal prosecution when President Bill Clinton attempt to use executive privilege regard the Lewinsky scandal the Supreme Court rule in Clinton v Jones U S that the privilege also could not be use in civil suit these case establish the legal precedent that executive privilege be valid although the exact extent of the privilege have yet to be clearly define additionally federal court have allow this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employee but have weaken that protection for those executive branch communication that do not involve the president the state secret privilege allow the president and the executive branch to withhold information or document from discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security precedent for the privilege arise early in the th century when Thomas Jefferson refuse to release military document in the treason trial of Aaron Burr and again in Totten v United States U S when the Supreme Court dismiss a case bring by a former Union spy however the privilege be not formally recognize by the U S Supreme Court until United States v Reynolds U S where it be hold to be a common law evidentiary privilege before the September attack use of the privilege have be rare but increase in frequency since the government have assert the privilege in more case and at earlier stage of the litigation thus in some instance cause dismissal of the suit before reach the merit of the claim as in the Ninth Circuit be ruling in Mohamed v Jeppesen Dataplan Inc critic of the privilege claim its use have become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government action legislative facilitator the Constitution s Ineligibility clause prevent the President and all other executive officer from simultaneously be a member of Congress therefore the president can not directly introduce legislative proposal for consideration in Congress however the president can take a indirect role in shape legislation especially if the president be political party have a majority in one or both house of Congress for example the president or other official of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senator or representative to introduce these draft into Congress the president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally mandate periodic report to Congress these report may be either write or oral but today be give as the state of the Union address which often outline the president be legislative proposal for the coming year additionally the president may attempt to have Congress alter propose legislation by threaten to veto that legislation unless request change be make in the th century critic begin charge that too many legislative and budgetary power have slide into the hand of president that should belong to Congress as the head of the executive branch president control a vast array of agency that can issue regulation with little oversight from Congress one critic charge that president could appoint a virtual army of czar each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet task with spearhead major policy effort for the White House Presidents

(file:/E:/Tutorial code/CS5560 - Tutorial 9 Source Code/Spark_KMeans_FV/data/20_news_group/output_wiki_uspreselection.txt,the election of President and Vice President of the United States be a indirect election in which citizen of the United States who be register to vote in one of the fifty state or Washington D C cast ballot for a set of member of the U S Electoral College know as elector these elector then in turn cast direct vote know as electoral vote for President and Vice President of the United States the candidate who receive a absolute majority of electoral vote for President or Vice President be then elect to that office if no candidate receive a absolute majority for President the House of Representatives choose the President if no one receive a majority for Vice President then the Senate choose the Vice President The Electoral College and its procedure be establish in the U S Constitution by Article II Section clause and and the Twelfth Amendment which replace clause after it be ratify in these presidential election occur quadrennially with register voter cast they ballot on Election Day which since have be the Tuesday after the first Monday in November coincide with the general election of various other federal state and local race the next U S presidential election the th quadrennial U S Presidential Election be schedule for November under Article II Section clause each state legislature be allow to designate a way of choose elector thus the popular vote on Election Day be conduct by the various state and not directly by the federal government in other word it be really a amalgamation of separate election hold in each state and Washington D C instead of a single national election once choose the elector can vote for anyone but with rare exception like a unpledged elector or faithless elector they vote for they designate candidate and they vote be certify by Congress who be the final judge of elector in early January the presidential term then officially begin on Inauguration Day January although the formal inaugural ceremony traditionally take place on the st if the th be a Sunday the nomination process consist of the primary election and caucus and the nominating convention be never specify in the Constitution and be instead develop over time by the state and the political party the primary election be stagger generally between January and June before the general election in November while the nominating convention be hold in the summer this too be also a indirect election process where voter from each U S state and Washington D C as well as those in U S territory cast ballot for a slate of delegate to a political party s nominate convention who then in turn elect they party be presidential nominee each party be presidential nominee then choose a vice presidential run mate to join with he or she on the same ticket and this choice be rubber stamp by the convention because of change to national campaign finance law since the s regard the disclosure of contribution for federal campaign presidential candidate from the major political party usually declare they intention to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year before the election thus the entire modern presidential campaign and election process usually take almost two year history Article two of the United States Constitution originally establish the method of presidential election include the Electoral College this be a result of a compromise between those constitutional framer who want the Congress to choose the president and those who prefer a national popular vote each state be allocate a number of elector that be equal to the size of its delegation in both house of Congress combine with the ratification of the rd amendment to the Constitution in the District of Columbia be also grant a number of elector equal to the number of those hold by the least populous state however U S territory be not represent in the Electoral College constitutionally the manner for choose elector be determine within each state by its legislature during the first presidential election in only of the original state choose elector by any form of popular vote gradually throughout the year the state begin conduct popular election to help choose they slate of elector result in the overall nationwide indirect election system that it be today under the original system establish by Article two elector could cast two vote to two different candidate for president the candidate with the highest number of vote provide it be a majority of the electoral vote become the president and the second place candidate become the vice president this present a problem during the presidential election of when Aaron Burr receive the same number of electoral vote as Thomas Jefferson and challenge Jefferson s election to the office in the end Jefferson be choose as the president because of Alexander Hamilton be influence in the House of Representatives this add to the deep rivalry between Burr and Hamilton which result in they famous duel in response to the election the th amendment be pass require elector to cast two distinct vote one for President and another for Vice President while this solve the problem at hand it ultimately have the effect of lower the prestige of the Vice Presidency as the office be no longer for the lead challenger for the Presidency the separate ballot for President and Vice President become something of a moot issue later in the th century when it become the norm for popular election to determine a state be Electoral College delegation elector choose this way be pledge to vote for a particular presidential and vice presidential candidate offer by the same political party so while the Constitution say that the President and Vice President be choose separately in practice they be choose together the th Amendment also establish rule when no candidate win a majority vote in the Electoral College in the presidential election of Andrew Jackson receive a plurality but not a majority of electoral vote cast the election be throw to the House of Representatives and John Quincy Adams be elect to the presidency a deep rivalry result between Andrew Jackson and House Speaker Henry Clay who have also be a candidate in the election since aside from the occasional faithless elector the popular vote determine the winner of a presidential election by determine the electoral vote as each state or district s popular vote determine its electoral college vote although the nationwide popular vote do not directly determine the winner of a presidential election it do strongly correlate with who be the victor in of the total election hold so far about percent the winner of the national popular vote have also carry the Electoral College vote the winner of the nationwide popular vote and the Electoral College vote differ only in close election in highly competitive election candidate focus on turn out they vote in the contest swing state critical to win a electoral college majority so they do not try to maximize they popular vote by real or fraudulent vote increase in one party area however candidate can fail to get the most vote in the nationwide popular vote in a presidential election and still win that election in the election Jackson win the popular vote but no one receive the majority of electoral vote accord to the th amendment in the Constitution the House of Representatives must choose the president out of the top people in the election Clay have come fourth so he throw he support to Adams who then win because Adams later name Clay he Secretary of State Jackson be supporter claim that Adams gain the presidency by make a deal with Clay Charges of a corrupt bargain follow Adams through he term then in and the winner of electoral vote lose the popular vote outright numerous constitutional amendment have be submit seek to replace the Electoral College with a direct popular vote but none have ever successfully pass both house of Congress another alternate proposal be the National Popular vote Interstate Compact a interstate compact whereby individual participate state agree to allocate they elector base on the winner of the national popular vote instead of just they respective statewide result the presidential election day be establish on a Tuesday in the month of November because of the factor involve weather harvest and worship when voter use to travel to the poll by horse Tuesday be a ideal day because it allow people to worship on Sunday ride to they county seat on Monday and vote on Tuesday all before market day Wednesday the month of November also fit nicely between harvest time and harsh winter weather which could be especially bad to people travel by horse and buggy until president be not swear in until March because it take so long to count and report ballot and because of the winner be logistical issue of move to the capital with better technology and the th Amendment be pass presidential inauguration be move to noon on January allow president to start they duty sooner the Federal Election Campaign Act of be enact to increase disclosure of contribution for federal campaign subsequent amendment to law require that candidate to a federal office must file a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission before they can receive contribution aggregate in excess of or make expenditure aggregate in excess of thus this begin a trend of presidential candidate declare they intention to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year so they can start raise and spend the money need for they nationwide campaign the first president George Washington be elect as a independent since the election of he successor John Adams in all winner of U S presidential election have represent one of two major party third party have take second place only twice in and the last time a third independent candidate achieve significant success although still finish in third place be in and the last time a third party candidate receive any electoral vote not from faithless elector be in Procedure eligibility requirement Article two of the United States Constitution stipulate that for a person to serve as President the individual must be a natural bear citizen of the United States at least year old and a resident of the United States for a period of no less than year a candidate may start run he or she campaign early before turn year old or complete year of residency but must meet the age and residency requirement by Inauguration Day the twenty second amendment to the Constitution also set a term limit a President can not be elect to more than two term the U S Constitution also have two provision that apply to all federal office in general not just the presidency Article I Section clause state that if the U S Congress convict any officer on impeachment they may also bar that person from hold any public office in the future and section of the fourteenth amendment prohibit the election to any federal office of any person who have previously hold any federal or state office and then engage in insurrection rebellion or treason this disqualification can be waive if such a individual gain the consent of two third of both house of Congress in addition the Twelfth Amendment establish that the Vice President must meet all of the qualification of be a President although not a mandatory requirement Federal campaign finance law include the Federal Election Campaign Act state that a candidate who intend to receive contribution aggregate in excess of or make expenditure aggregate in excess of among other must first file a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission this have lead presidential candidate especially member from the two major political party to officially announce they intention to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year so they can start raise or spend the money need for they nationwide campaign potential candidate usually form exploratory committee even earlier to determine the feasibility of they actually run nominating process the modern nominating process of U S presidential election currently consist of two major part a series of presidential primary election and caucus hold in each state and the presidential nominating convention hold by each political party this process be never include in the United States Constitution and thus evolve over time by the political party to clear the field of candidate the primary election be run by state and local government while the caucus be organize directly by the political party some state hold only primary election some hold only caucus and other use a combination of both these primary and caucus be stagger generally between January and June before the federal election with Iowa and New Hampshire traditionally hold the first presidential state caucus and primary respectively like the general election presidential caucus or primary be indirect election the major political party officially vote for they presidential candidate at they respective nominating convention usually all hold in the summer before the federal election depend on each state be law and state s political party rule when voter cast ballot for a candidate in a presidential caucus or primary they may be vote to award delegate bind to vote for a candidate at the presidential nominating convention or they may simply be express a opinion that the state party be not bind to follow in select delegate to they respective national convention unlike the general election voter in the U S territory can also elect delegate to the national convention furthermore each political party can determine how many delegate to allocate to each state and territory in for example the democratic and republican party convention each use two different formula to allocate delegate the Democrats base theirs on two main factor the proportion of vote each state give to the democratic candidate in the previous three presidential election and the number of electoral vote each state have in the Electoral College in contrast the Republicans assign to each state delegate plus delegate per congressional district both party then give fix amount of delegate to each territory and finally bonus delegate to state and territory that pass certain criterion along with delegate choose during primary and caucus state and U S territory delegation to both the democratic and republican party convention also include unpledged delegate that have a vote for Republicans they consist of the three top party official from each state and territory democrat have a more expansive group of unpledged delegate call superdelegate who be party leader and elect official each party be presidential candidate also choose a vice presidential nominee to run with he or she on the same ticket and this choice be rubber stamp by the convention if no single candidate have secure a majority of delegate include both pledge and unpledged then a brokered convention result all pledge delegate be then release and be able to switch they allegiance to a different candidate thereafter the nomination be decide through a process of alternate political horse trading and additional round of re vote the popular vote on Election Day under the United States Constitution the manner of choose elector for the Electoral College be determine by each state be legislature although each state currently designate elector by popular vote other method be allow for instance a number of state formerly choose presidential elector by a vote of the state legislature itself however federal law do specify that all elector must be select on the same day which be the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November i e a Tuesday no earlier than November and no later than November Today the state and the District of Columbia each conduct they own popular election on Election Day to help determine they respective slate of elector thus the presidential election be really a amalgamation of separate and simultaneous state election instead of a single national election run by the federal government like any other election in the United States the eligibility of a individual for voting be set out in the Constitution and regulate at state level the Constitution state that suffrage can not be deny on grounds of race or color sex or age for citizen eighteen year or older beyond these basic qualification it be the responsibility of state legislature to regulate voter eligibility generally voter be require to vote on a ballot where they select the candidate of they choice the presidential ballot be a vote for the elector of a candidate meaning that the voter be not vote for the candidate but endorse a slate of elector pledge to vote for a specific presidential and vice presidential candidate many voting ballot allow a voter to blanket vote for all candidate in a particular political party or to select individual candidate on a line by line voting system which candidate appear on the voting ticket be determine through a legal process know as ballot access usually the size of the candidate be political party and the result of the major nomination convention determine who be pre list on the presidential ballot thus the presidential election ticket will not list every candidate run for President but only those who have secure a major party nomination or whose size of they political party warrant have be formally list law be in effect to have other candidate pre list on a ticket provide that enough voter have endorse the candidate usually through a signature list the final way to be elect for president be to have one s name write in at the time of election as a write in candidate this be use for candidate who do not fulfill the legal requirement to be pre list on the voting ticket it be also use by voter to express a distaste for the list candidate by write in a alternative candidate for president such as Mickey Mouse or comedian Stephen Colbert whose application be vote down by the South Carolina Democratic Party in any event a write in candidate have never win a election for President of the United States because U S territory be not represent in the Electoral College U S citizen in those area do not vote in the general election for President Guam have hold straw poll for president since the election to draw attention to this fact Electoral college most state law establish a winner take all system wherein the ticket that win a plurality of vote win all of that state be allocate electoral vote and thus have they slate of elector choose to vote in the Electoral College Maine and Nebraska do not use this method opt instead to give two electoral vote to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district each state be win slate of elector then meet at they respective state s capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December to cast they electoral vote on separate ballot for President and Vice President although Electoral College member can technically vote for anyone under the U S Constitution state have law to punish faithless elector those who do not cast they electoral vote for the person whom they have pledge to elect in early January the total Electoral College vote count be open by the sit Vice President act in he capacity as President of the Senate and read aloud to a joint session of the incoming Congress which be elect at the same time as the President if no candidate receive a majority of the electoral vote currently at least the President be determine by the rule outline by the th amendment specifically the selection of President would then be decide by a ballot of the House of Representatives for the purpose of elect the President each state have only one vote a ballot of the Senate be hold to choose the Vice President in this ballot each senator have one vote the House of Representatives have choose the victor of the presidential race only twice in and the Senate have choose the victor of the vice presidential race only once in if the President be not choose by Inauguration Day the Vice President elect act as President if neither be choose by then Congress by law determine who shall act as President pursuant to the th Amendment unless there be faithless elector dispute or other controversy the event in December and January mention above be largely a formality since the winner can be determine base on the state by state popular vote result between the general election and Inauguration Day this apparent winner be refer to as the President elect unless it be a sit president that have win re election election calendar the typical period of the presidential election process be as follow with the date correspond to the general election spring candidate announce they intention to run and if necessary file they statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission August to March primary and caucus debate February to June Primaries and caucus April to August nominate convention include those of the minor third party September and October presidential election debate November Election Day December Electors cast they electoral vote early January Congress count and certify the electoral vote January Inauguration Day trend

Technology and media advance in technology and media have also affect presidential campaign the invention of both radio and television have give way to the reliance of national political advertisement across those method of communication National advertisement such as Lyndon B Johnson be commercial Daisy Ronald Reagan be commercial morning in America and George H W Bush be commercial revolving Door become major factor in those respective election in George H W Bush be promise of Read my lip no new tax be extensively use in the commercial of Bill Clinton and Bush be other opponent with significant effect during the campaign since the development of the internet in the mid s internet activism have also become a invaluable component of presidential campaign especially since the internet be first use in the presidential election but primarily as a brochure for the candidate online it be only use by a few candidate and there be no evidence of any major effect on the outcome of that election cycle in both candidate George W Bush and Al Gore create maintained and update they campaign website but it be not until the presidential election cycle be the potential value of the internet see by the summer of ten people compete in the presidential election have develop campaign website Howard Dean be campaign website from that year be consider a model for all future campaign website he website play a significant role in he overall campaign strategy it allow he supporter to read about he campaign platform and provide feedback donate get involve with the campaign and connect with other supporter a Gallup poll from January reveal that percent of Americans have use the internet to get information about candidate and percent say that they use the internet to get this information frequently in the internet become a grassroot and a voice of the people tool a way for the user to connect with each other and with the campaign like Dean be website have do in all of the major candidate have a website and utilize social networking like Facebook and MySpace the popularity of a candidate could be measure by the number of friend on these site as well as on website like Hitwise which list the number of hit all of the presidential candidate s website have each week internet channel such as YouTube be use by candidate to share speech and ad for free this also serve as a forum for user to attack other candidate by upload video of gaffe a study do by the Pew Internet American Life Project in conjunction with Princeton Survey Research Associates in November show that percent of adult in the United States use the internet to get information about the midterm election and about specific candidate this represent percent of adult internet user the study also show that percent of adult internet user use social network site or Twitter to get information about and discuss the election and percent of all adult use cell phone to learn about or participate in campaign e campaigning as it have come to be call be subject to very little regulation on March the Federal Election Commission vote unanimously to not regulate political communication on the internet include email blog and the create of web site this decision make only pay political ad place on website subject to campaign finance limitation a comment be make about this decision by Roger Alan Stone of Advocacy Inc that explain this loophole in the context of a political campaign a wealthy individual could purchase all of the e mail address for register voter in a congressional district produce a internet video ad and e mail it along with a link to the campaign contribution page not only would this activity not count against any contribution limit or independent expenditure requirement it would never even need to be report criticism today the presidential election process remain controversial with critic argue that it be inherently undemocratic and discourage voter participation and turnout in many area of the country because of the staggered nature of the primary season voter in Iowa New Hampshire and other small state which traditionally hold they primary and caucus first in January usually have a major impact on the race campaign activity media attention and voter participation be usually higher in these state as the candidate attempt to build momentum and generate a bandwagon effect in these early primary conversely voter in California and other large state which traditionally hold they primary last in June usually end up have no say in who the presidential candidate will be the race be usually over by then and thus the campaign the media and voter have little incentive to participate in these late primary as a result more state vie for earlier primary to claim a greater influence in the process however compress the primary calendar in this way limit the ability of lesser known candidate to effectively corral resource and raise they visibility among voter especially when compete with better known candidate who have more financial resource and the institutional backing of they party be establishment primary and caucus reform proposal include a National primary hold on a single day or the Interregional primary plan where state would be group into six region and each of the region would rotate every election on who would hold they primary first with the primary race usually over before June the political convention have mostly become script ceremonial affair as the drama have leave the convention and complaint grow that they be script and dull pep rally public interest and viewership have fall off after formerly offer gavel to gavel coverage of the major party convention in the mid th Century the Big three television network now only devote approximately three hour of coverage one hour per night critic also argue that the Electoral College be archaic and inherently undemocratic with all but two state the exception be Maine and Nebraska use a winner take all system both the democratic and the Republican candidate be all but certain to win all the electoral vote from those state whose resident predominantly vote for the Democratic Party or the Republican Party respectively this encourage presidential candidate to focus exponentially more time money and energy campaigning in a few so call swing state state in which no single candidate or party have overwhelming support such swing state like Ohio be inundate with campaign visit saturation television advertising get out the vote effort by party organizer and debate meanwhile candidate and political party have no incentive to mount nationwide campaign effort or work to increase voter turnout in predominately democratic Party safe state like California or predominately Republican Party safe state like Texas in practice the winner take all system also both reinforce the country be two party system and decrease the importance of third and minor political party furthermore a candidate can win the electoral vote without secure the greatest amount of the national popular vote such as during the and election in theory it be possible to secure the necessary electoral vote from just the top populous state and then ignore the rest of the country Constitutional amendment such as the every vote count amendment have be propose seek to replace the Electoral College with a direct popular vote which proponent argue would increase turnout and participation other propose reform include the National Popular vote Interstate Compact a interstate compact without congressional authorization whereby individual participate state agree to allocate they elector base on the winner of the national popular vote instead of vote they respective statewide result another proposal be for every state to simply adopt the District system use by Maine and Nebraska give two electoral vote to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district the Automatic Plan would replace the Electors with a automatic tally of vote to eliminate the faithless elector affect the outcome of the election the proportional plan often compare to the District Plan would distribute electoral vote in each state in proportion to the popular vote introduce third party effect in election outcome the House Plan would require a constitutional amendment to allocate elector base on the House apportionment alone to lessen small state advantage direct election plan and bonus plan have in common a higher valuation on the popular vote for president Electoral college result the follow be a table of electoral college result for simplicity candidate list be only those that receive at least of the total popular vote or more than one electoral vote for election include and after or greater than electoral vote for election include and before political party of each candidate be indicate in parenthesis winner receive less than a absolute majority of the popular vote lose candidate receive a plurality of the popular vote lose candidate receive a absolute majority of the popular vote as the second place winner be elect Vice President as per the law in effect prior to the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment Voter turnout Voter turnout in the and election show a noticeable increase over the turnout in and prior to voter turnout in presidential election have be decrease while voter registration measure in term of vote age population vap by the U S Census have be increase the vap figure however include person ineligible to vote mainly non citizen and ineligible felon and exclude overseas eligible voter Opinion be mix on whether this decline be due to voter apathy or a increase in ineligible voter on the roll the difference between these two measure be illustrate by analysis of turnout in the and election Voter turnout from the and election be not statistically different base on the voting age population use by a November U S Census survey of household if express in term of vote eligible population VEP the national turnout rate be from million ballot cast for president a increase of over percentage point over the turnout rate of and the highest since Financial disclosure prior to many presidential candidate disclose asset stock holding and other information which might affect the public trust in that year republican candidate George W Romney go a step further and release he tax return for the previous twelve year since then many presidential candidate include all major party nominee since have release some of they return although few of the major party nominee have equal or exceed George Romney be twelve presidential coattail presidential election be hold on the same date as those for all the seat in the United States House of Representatives the full term for or of the seat in the United States Senate the governorship in several U S state as well as many state and local election presidential candidate tend to bring out supporter who then vote for they party be candidate for those other office member of the U S Senate or House of Representatives be also more

president be indirectly elect together with the president to a four year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College The vice president be the first person in the presidential line of succession and would normally ascend to the presidency upon the death resignation or removal of the president the Office of the Vice President of the United States assist and organize the vice president s official function the vice president be also president of the United States Senate and in that capacity only vote when it be necessary to break a tie while Senate custom have create supermajority rule that have diminish this constitutional tie break authority the vice president still retain the ability to influence legislation for example the Deficit Reduction Act of be pass in the Senate by a tie breaking vice presidential vote additionally pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment the vice president preside over the joint session of Congress when it convene to count the vote of the Electoral College while the vice president be only constitutionally prescribe function aside from presidential succession relate to they role as President of the Senate the office be commonly view as a component of the executive branch of the federal government the United States Constitution do not expressly assign the office to any one branch cause a dispute among scholar whether it belong to the executive branch the legislative branch or both the modern view of the vice president as a member of the executive branch be due in part to the assignment of executive duty to the vice president by either the president or Congress though such activity be only recent historical development Origin the creation of the office of vice president be a direct consequence of the creation of the Electoral College Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention give each state a number of presidential elector equal to that state be combined share of House and Senate seat yet the delegate be worry that each elector would only favor he own state s favorite son candidate result in deadlock election that would produce no winner to counter this potential difficulty the delegate give each presidential elector two vote require that at least one of they vote be for a candidate from outside the elector be state they also mandate that the winner of a election must obtain a absolute majority of the total number of elector the delegate expect that each elector be second vote would go to a statesman of national character fear that elector might throw away they second vote to bolster they favorite son s chance of win however the Philadelphia delegate specify that the runner up would become vice president create this new office impose a political cost on discard vote and force elector to cast they second ballot role of the vice president the Constitution limit the formal power and role of vice president to become president should the president become unable to serve prompt the well know expression only a heartbeat away from the presidency and to act as the preside officer of the U S Senate other statutorily grant role include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution President of the United States Senate as President of the Senate the vice president have two primary duty to cast a vote in the event of a Senate deadlock and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U S Electoral College for example in the first half of the Senators be divide between Republicans and Democrats and Dick Cheney be tie break vote give the Republicans the Senate majority regular duty as President of the Senate Article I Section clause the vice president oversee procedural matter and may cast a tie break vote there be a strong convention within the U S Senate that the vice president should not use they position as President of the Senate to influence the passage of legislation or act in a partisan manner except in the case of break tie vote as President of the Senate John Adams cast twenty nine tie break vote a record no successor except John C Calhoun ever threaten Adams s vote protect the president be sole authority over the removal of appointee influence the location of the national capital and prevent war with great Britain on at least one occasion Adams persuade senator to vote against legislation he oppose and he frequently address the Senate on procedural and policy matter Adams be political view and he active role in the Senate make he a natural target for critic of George Washington be administration toward the end of he first term a threaten resolution that would have silence he except for procedural and policy matter cause he to exercise more restraint in hope of see he election as President of the United States formerly the vice president would preside regularly over Senate proceedings but in modern time the vice president rarely preside over day to day matter in the Senate in they place the Senate choose a President pro tempore or president for a time to preside in the vice president be absence the Senate normally select the longest serve senator in the majority party the President pro tempore have the power to appoint any other senator to preside and in practice junior senator from the majority party be assign the task of preside over the Senate at most time except for this tie break role the stand rule of the Senate vest no significant responsibility in the vice president rule xix which govern debate do not authorize the vice president to participate in debate and grant only to member of the Senate and upon appropriate notice former president of the United States the privilege of address the Senate without grant a similar privilege to the sit vice president thus as Time magazine write during the controversial tenure of Vice President Charles G Dawes once in four year the Vice President can make a little speech and then he be do for four year he then have to sit in the seat of the silent attend to speech ponderous or otherwise of deliberation or humor recur infrequent duty the president of the Senate also preside over counting and presentation of the vote of the Electoral College this process occur in the presence of both house of Congress generally on January of the year follow a U S presidential election in this capacity only four vice president have be able to announce they own election to the presidency John Adams Thomas Jefferson Martin Van Buren and George H W Bush at the beginning of it fall to Richard Nixon to preside over this process which officially announce the election of he opponent John f Kennedy in Al Gore announce the election of he opponent George W Bush in Vice President Hubert Humphrey would have announce the election of he opponent Richard Nixon however on the date of the congressional joint session January Humphrey be in Norway attend the funeral of Trygve lie the first elect Secretary General of the United Nations in incumbent Vice President Charles Curtis announce the election of House Speaker John Nance Garner as he successor while Garner be seat next to he on the House dai the president of the Senate may also preside over most of the impeachment trial of federal officer however whenever the President of the United States be impeach the US Constitution require the Chief Justice of the United States to preside over the Senate for the trial the Constitution be silent as to the preside officer in the instance where the vice president be the officer impeach succession and the twenty Fifth Amendment The U S Constitution provide that should the president die become disabled while in office or remove from office the power and duty of the office be transfer to the vice president initially it be unclear whether the vice president actually become the new president or merely a act president this be first test in with the death of President William Henry Harrison Harrison be vice president John Tyler assert that he have succeed to the full presidential office power and title and decline to acknowledge document refer to he as Acting President despite some strong call against it Tyler take the oath of office as the tenth President Tyler be claim be not challenge legally and so the Tyler precedent of full succession be establish this be make explicit by section of the twenty fifth amendment to the U S Constitution ratify in section of the twenty fifth amendment provide for vice presidential succession Whenever there be a vacancy in the office of the Vice President the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both house of Congress Gerald Ford be the first vice president select by this method after the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew in after succeed to the presidency Ford nominate Nelson Rockefeller as vice president another issue be who have the power to declare that a incapacitated president be unable to discharge he duty this question have arise most recently with the illness of President Dwight D Eisenhower Section and Section of the amendment provide mean for the vice president to become acting president upon the temporary disability of the president section deal with self declare incapacity of the president section deal with incapacity declare by the joint action of the vice president and of a majority of the Cabinet while Section have never be invoke section have be invoke three time on July when Ronald Reagan undergo surgery to remove cancerous polyp from he colon and twice more on June and July when George W Bush undergo colonoscopy procedure require sedation prior to this amendment Vice President Richard Nixon informally assume some of President Dwight Eisenhower be duty for several week on each of three occasion when Eisenhower be ill informal role the extent of any informal role and function of the vice president depend on the specific relationship between the president and the vice president but often include task such as drafter and spokesperson for the administration be policy adviser to the president and be a symbol of american concern or support the influence of the vice president in this role depend almost entirely on the characteristic of the particular administration Dick Cheney for instance be widely regard as one of President George W Bush be closest confidant Al Gore be a important adviser to President Bill Clinton on matter of foreign policy and the environment often vice president be choose to act as a balance to the president take either more moderate or radical position on issue under the american system the president be both head of state and head of government and the ceremonial duty of the former position be often delegate to the vice president the vice president be often assign the ceremonial duty of represent the president and the government at state funeral or other function in the United States this often be the most visible role of the vice president and have occasionally be the subject of ridicule such as during the vice presidency of George H W Bush the vice president may meet with other head of state or attend state funeral in other country at time when the administration wish to demonstrate concern or support but can not send the president themselves Office as step stone to the presidency in recent decade the vice presidency have frequently be use as a platform to launch bid for the presidency the transition of the office to its modern stature occur primarily as a result of Franklin Roosevelt be nomination when he capture the ability to nominate he run mate instead of leave the nomination to the convention prior to that party boss often use the vice presidential nomination as a consolation prize for the party be minority faction a further factor potentially contribute to the rise in prestige of the office be the adoption of presidential preference primary in the early th century by adopt primary vote the field of candidate for vice president be expand by both the increase quantity and quality of presidential candidate successful in some primary yet who ultimately fail to capture the presidential nomination at the convention of the thirteen presidential election from to nine feature the incumbent president the other four all feature the incumbent vice president former vice president also run in Walter Mondale and in Richard Nixon against the incumbent vice president Hubert Humphrey The first presidential election to include neither the incumbent president nor the incumbent vice president on a major party ticket since come in when President George W Bush have already serve two term and Vice President Cheney choose not to run Richard Nixon be also the only non sit vice president to be elect president as well as the only person to be elect president and vice president twice each selection process eligibility the Twelfth Amendment state that no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States thus to serve as vice president a individual must be a natural bear U S citizen be at least year old have reside in the U S at least year disqualification additionally section of the fourteenth amendment deny eligibility for any federal office to anyone who have swear a oath to support the United States Constitution later have rebel against the United States this disqualification originally aim at former supporter of the Confederacy may be remove by a two third vote of each house of the Congress under the twenty second amendment the President of the United States may not be elect to more than two term however there be no similar such limitation as to how many time one can be elect vice president scholar disagree whether a former president bar from election to the presidency be also ineligible to be elect or appoint vice president as suggest by the Twelfth Amendment the issue have never be test in practice also Article I Section clause allow the Senate upon vote to remove a impeach federal official from office to disqualify that official from hold any federal office residency limitation while it be commonly hold that the president and vice president must be resident of different state this be not actually the case nothing in the Constitution prohibit both candidate be from a single state instead the limitation impose be on the member of the Electoral College who must cast a ballot for at least one candidate who be not from they own state in theory the candidate elect could both be from one state but the elector of that state would in a close electoral contest run the risk of deny they vice presidential candidate the absolute majority require to secure the election even if the presidential candidate be elect this would then place the vice presidential election in the hand of the Senate in practice however residency be rarely a issue party have avoid nominating ticket contain two candidate from the same state further the candidate may themselves take action to alleviate any residency conflict for example at the start of the election cycle Dick Cheney be a resident of Texas Cheney quickly change he residency back to Wyoming where he have previously serve as a U S Representative when Texas governor and republican presidential nominee George W Bush ask Cheney to be he vice presidential candidate nominating process though the vice president need not have any political experience most major party vice presidential nominee be current or former United States Senators or Representatives with the occasional nominee be a current or former governor a high ranking military officer or a holder of a major post within the Executive Department the vice presidential candidate of the major national political party be formally select by each party be quadrennial nominating convention follow the selection of the party be presidential candidate the official process be identical to the one by which the presidential candidate be choose with delegate place the name of candidate into nomination follow by a ballot in which candidate must receive a majority to secure the party be nomination in practice the presidential nominee have considerable influence on the decision and in the th century it become customary for that person to select a preferred running mate who be then nominate and accept by the convention in recent year with the presidential nomination usually be a foregone conclusion as the result of the primary process the selection of a vice presidential candidate be often announce prior to the actual balloting for the presidential candidate and sometimes before the beginning of the convention itself the first presidential aspirant to announce he selection for vice president before the beginning of the convention be Ronald Reagan who prior to the Republican National Convention announce that Richard Schweiker would be he run mate Reagan be supporter then seek to amend the convention rule so that Gerald R Ford would be require to name he vice presidential run mate in advance as well the proposal be defeat and Reagan do not receive the nomination in often the presidential nominee will name a vice presidential candidate who will bring geographic or ideological balance to the ticket or appeal to a particular constituency the vice presidential candidate might also be choose on the basis of trait the presidential candidate be perceive to lack or on the basis of name recognition to foster party unity popular runner up in the presidential nomination process be commonly consider while this selection process may enhance the chance of success for a national ticket in the past it often insure that the vice presidential nominee represent region constituency or ideology at odds with those of the presidential candidate as a result vice president be often exclude from the policy make process of the new administration many time they relationship with the president and he staff be aloof non existent or even adversarial the ultimate goal of vice presidential candidate selection be to help and not hurt the party be chance of get elect a selection whose positive trait make the presidential candidate look less favorable in comparison can backfire such as in when democratic candidate Michael Dukakis choose experienced Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen and in when republican candidate John McCain pick dynamic Alaska Governor Sarah Palin however Palin also hurt McCain when she interview with Katie Couric lead to concern about she fitness for the presidency in Walter Mondale pick Geraldine Ferraro whose nomination become a drag on the ticket due to repeat question about she husband be finances question about Dan Quayle be experience and temperament be raise in the presidential campaign of George H W Bush but he still win James Stockdale the choice of third party candidate Ross Perot in be see as unqualified by many but the Perot Stockdale ticket still win about of the vote Historically vice presidential candidate be choose to provide geographic and ideological balance to a presidential ticket widen a presidential candidate s appeal to voter from outside he regional base or wing of the party candidate from electoral vote rich state be usually prefer however in moderate Democrat Bill Clinton of Arkansas choose moderate Democrat Al Gore of Tennessee as he run mate despite the two candidate near identical ideological and regional background Gore be extensive experience in national affair enhance the appeal of a ticket head by Clinton whose political career have be spend entirely at the local and state level of government in George W Bush choose Dick Cheney of Wyoming a reliably republican state with only three electoral vote and in Barack Obama mirror Bush s strategy when he choose Joe Biden of Delaware a reliably democratic state likewise one with only three electoral vote both Cheney and Biden be choose for they experience in national politics experience lack by both Bush and Obama rather than the ideological balance or electoral vote advantage they would provide the first presidential candidate to choose he vice presidential candidate be Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the last not to name a vice presidential choice leave the matter up to the convention be Democrat Adlai Stevenson in the convention choose Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver over Massachusetts Senator and later president John f Kennedy at the tumultuous democratic convention presidential nominee George McGovern select Senator Thomas Eagleton as he run mate but numerous other candidate be either nominate from the floor or receive vote during the balloting Eagleton nevertheless receive a majority of the vote and the nomination though he later resign from the ticket result in Sargent Shriver become McGovern s final run mate both lose to the Nixon Agnew ticket by a wide margin carry only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia in case where the presidential nomination be still in doubt as the convention approach the campaign for the two position may become intertwine in Ronald Reagan who be trail President Gerald R Ford in the presidential delegate count announce prior to the Republican National Convention that if nominate he would select Senator Richard Schweiker as he run mate this move backfire to a degree as Schweiker be relatively liberal voting record alienate many of the more conservative delegate who be consider a challenge to party delegate selection rule to improve Reagan s chance in the end Ford narrowly win the presidential nomination and Reagan be selection of Schweiker become moot election oath and tenure Vice president be elect indirectly in the United States a number of elector collectively know as the Electoral College officially select the president on Election Day voter in each of the state and the District of Columbia cast ballot for these elector each state be allocate a number of elector equal to the size of its delegation in both house of Congress combine generally the ticket that win the most vote in a state win all of that state be electoral vote and thus have its slate of elector choose to vote in the Electoral College The win slate of elector meet at its state be capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December about six week after the election to vote they then send a record of that vote to Congress the vote of the elector be open by the sit vice president act in he capacity as President of the Senate and read aloud to a joint session of the incoming Congress which be elect at the same time as the president pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment the vice president be term of office begin at noon on January of the year follow the election this date know as Inauguration Day mark the beginning of the four year term of both the president and vice president although Article VI require that the vice president take a oath or affirmation of allegiance to the US Constitution unlike the president the United States Constitution do not specify the precise wording of the oath of office for the vice president several variant of the oath have be use since the current form which be also recite by Senators Representatives and other government officer have be use since I a b do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemy foreign and domestic that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duty of the office on which I be about to enter so help I God The term of office for vice president be four year while the twenty Second Amendment generally restrict the president to two term there be no similar limitation on the office of vice president mean a eligible person could hold the office as long as voter continue to vote for elector who in turn would renew the vice president be tenure a vice president could even serve under different administration as George Clinton and John C Calhoun have do original election process and reform under the original term of the Constitution the elector of the Electoral College vote only for office of president rather than for both president and vice president each elector be allow to vote for two people for the top office the person receive the greatest number of vote provide that such a number be a majority of elector would be president while the individual who receive the next largest number of vote become vice president if no one receive a majority of vote then the House of Representatives would choose among the five candidate with the largest number of vote with each state be representative together cast a single vote in such a case the person who receive the highest number of vote but be not choose president would become vice president in the case of a tie for second then the Senate would choose the vice president the original plan however do not foresee the development of political party and they adversarial role in the government for example in the election of Federalist John Adams come in first but because the Federalist elector have divide they second vote amongst several vice presidential candidate democratic Republican Thomas Jefferson come second thus the president and vice president be from oppose party predictably Adams and Jefferson clash over issue such as state rights and foreign policy a greater problem occur in the election of in which the two participate party each have a secondary candidate they intend to elect as vice president but the more popular democratic Republican party fail to execute that plan with they electoral vote under the system in place at the time Article II Section clause the elector could not differentiate between they two candidate so the plan have be for one elector to vote for Thomas Jefferson but not for Aaron Burr thus put Burr in second place this plan break down for reason that be dispute and both candidate receive the same number of vote after deadlock ballot in the House of Representatives Jefferson finally win on the th ballot and Burr become vice president this tumultuous affair lead to the adoption of the Twelfth Amendment in which direct the elector to use separate ballot to vote for the president and vice president while this solve the problem at hand it ultimately have the effect of lower the prestige of the vice presidency as the office be no longer for the lead challenger for the presidency the separate ballot for president and vice president become something of a moot issue later in the th century when it become the norm for popular election to determine a state be Electoral College delegation elector choose this way be pledge to vote for a particular presidential and vice presidential candidate offer by the same political party so while the Constitution say that the president and vice president be choose separately in practice they be choose together if no vice presidential candidate receive a Electoral College majority then the Senate select the vice president in accordance with the United States Constitution the Twelfth Amendment state that a majority of the whole number of senator currently of be necessary for election further the language require a absolute majority of Senate vote preclude the sit vice president from break any tie which might occur the election of be the only election so far where the office of the vice president have be decide by the Senate during the campaign Martin Van Buren be run mate Richard Mentor Johnson be accuse of have live with a black woman Virginia be elector who be pledge to Van Buren and Johnson refuse to vote for Johnson but still vote for Van Buren The election go to the Senate where Johnson be elect Salary the vice president be salary be the salary be set by the Government Salary Reform Act which also provide a automatic cost of live adjustment for federal employee the vice president do not automatically receive a pension base on that office but instead receive the same pension as other member of Congress base on he position as President of the Senate the vice president must serve a minimum of five year to qualify for a pension since the official residence of the vice president and they family have be Number one Observatory Circle on the grounds of the United States Naval Observatory in Washington D C Vacancy Article I Section clause and article ii section of the Constitution both authorize the House of Representatives to serve as a grand jury with the power to impeach high federal official include the president for treason bribery or other high crime and misdemeanor similarly Article I Section clause and Article II Section both authorize the Senate to serve as a court with the power to remove impeach official from office give a two third vote to convict no vice president have ever be impeach prior to ratification of the twenty fifth amendment in no provision exist for fill a vacancy in the office of vice president as a result the vice presidency be leave vacant time sometimes for nearly four year until the next ensue election and inauguration eight time due to the death of the sit president result in the vice president become president seven time due to the death of the sit vice president and once due to the resignation of Vice President John C Calhoun to become a senator Calhoun resign because he have be drop from the ticket by President Andrew Jackson in favor of Martin Van Buren due primarily to conflict with the President over the issue of nullification already a lame duck vice president he be elect to the Senate by the South Carolina state legislature and resign the vice presidency early to begin he Senate term because he believe he would have more power as a senator since the adoption of the twenty Fifth Amendment the office have be vacant twice while await confirmation of the new vice president by both house of Congress the first such instance occur in follow the resignation of Spiro Agnew as Richard Nixon be vice president Gerald Ford be subsequently nominate by President Nixon and confirm by Congress the second occur month later when Nixon resign follow the Watergate scandal and Ford assume the presidency the result vice presidential vacancy be fill by Nelson Rockefeller Ford and Rockefeller be the only two people to have serve as vice president without have be elect to the office and Ford remain the only person to have serve as both vice president and president without be elect to either office once the election be over the Vice President be usefulness be over he be like the second stage of a rocket he be damn important go into orbit but he be always throw off to burn up in the atmosphere the twenty Fifth Amendment also make provision for a replacement in the event that the vice president die in office resign be remove from office via impeachment conviction or succeed to the presidency the original Constitution have no provision for select such a replacement so the office of vice president would remain vacant until the beginning of the next presidential and vice presidential term this issue have arise most recently when the John f Kennedy assassination cause a vacancy from November until January and be rectify by section of the twenty Fifth Amendment growth of the office for much of its existence the office of vice president be see as little more than a minor position Adams the first vice president be the first of many who find the job frustrating and stupefying write to he wife Abigail that my country have in its wisdom contrived for I the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or he imagination conceive many vice president lament the lack of meaningful work in they role John Nance Garner who serve as vice president from to under President Franklin D Roosevelt

Party ask Daniel Webster to run for the vice presidency on Zachary Taylor be ticket he reply I do not propose to be bury until I be really dead and in my coffin this be the second time Webster decline the office which William Henry Harrison have first offer to he Ironically both of the president make the offer to Webster die in office mean the three time presidential candidate could have become president if he have accept either since president rarely die in office however the better preparation for the presidency be consider to be the office of Secretary of State in which Webster serve under Harrison Tyler and later Taylor s successor Fillmore for many year the vice president be give few responsibility Garret Hobart the first vice president under William McKinley be one of the very few vice president at this time who play a important role in the administration a close confidant and adviser of the president Hobart be call Assistant President however until vice president be not

both appoint to the office under the term of the th amendment be inaugurate in the House and Senate chamber respectively Garner be successor Henry Wallace be give major responsibility during the war but he move further to the left than the Democratic Party and the rest of the Roosevelt administration and be relieve of actual power Roosevelt keep he last vice president Harry Truman uninformed on
